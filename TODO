An incomplete list of what is still to be done:

- add to documentation that xterm users should set: XTerm*metaSendsEscape: true, otherwise alt-1 a.o. won't work
- port to libtickit and stop using ncurses/libtermkey
- also support just 2 files
- add scrollbar (read-only, just to show where you are in the file)

support keys:
- ctrl-c/ctrl-v -> copy/paste
- ctrl-insert/shift-insert -> copy/paste

selection keys
- shift-arrows -> char/line selection
- ctrl-shift-left/right -> word selection (figure out what keys to assign to scrolling the input panes)
- shift-home/end -> select to beginning/end of line
- ctrl-shift-home/end -> select to beginning/end of file
- shift-page up/down -> select to prev/next page

- graceful degradation of colors

- add configuration file and settings dialog
  - kdiff3's settings: tab inserts spaces, tab size, auto indentation

- implement mmap for input file reading
- implement decoding filter for non-utf8 input files

The following features will follow when requested
- implement line preprocessing filter for input files
- (if it helps performance) implement a decoded/preprocessed line cache filter for input files
