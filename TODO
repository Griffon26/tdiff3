Already implemented:
- kdiff3's comparison algorithm
- diff view of three files. The only thing you can do is scroll one line/column at a time.

I plan to follow the following list from top to bottom for implementing new
functionality. 

- add to documentation that xterm users should set: XTerm*metaSendsEscape: true, otherwise alt-1 a.o. won't work
- fix bug: d3ll should not have any completely empty entries at the end
- implement ncurses ui
  - graceful degradation of colors
    rxvt-unicode: 88, changeable
    xterm: 8                                  ****************** problem ********************
    xterm-256color: 256, changeable
    linux: 8, changeable
    screen-256color within urxvt: 256 (screen converts 256 downto 88) ***** problem *****
    screen-256color within xterm: 256 (screen converts 256 downto 8) ****** problem ***********
    screen-256color within xterm-256color: 256
    screen within xterm: 8 *** problem ***
    screen within urxvt: 8 *** problem ***

    
  - also support just 2 files
  - add scrollbar (read-only, just to show where you are in the file)
  - create editable window (text only edited on screen, not backed by memory/file)

    general:
    - limit cursor movement to line content

    supported keys:
    - arrows for navigation
    - regular chars
    - delete, backspace
    - home, end
    - pageup/down
    - ctrl-home/ctrl-end
    - ctrl-c/ctrl-v -> copy/paste
    - ctrl-insert/shift-insert -> copy/paste
    - tab -> insert spaces upto tabstop

    selection keys
    - shift-arrows -> char/line selection
    - ctrl-shift-left/right -> word selection
    - shift-home/end -> select to beginning/end of line
    - ctrl-shift-home/end -> select to beginning/end of file
    - shift-page up/down -> select to prev/next page

    support for full-width characters:
    - move cursor 2 places with one keypress (this should make it impossible to
      start typing/deleting while in the middle of a full-width char)

  - implement memory/file storage for editable window
    - only store edits wrt the original content

- implement merging (without manual editing at first)
    diff specific keys
    - ctrl-up/down -> prev/next difference
    - ctrl-pageup/down -> prev/next conflict
    - ctrl-1/2/3 -> append/remove line from A/B/C at selected conflict position
- implement manual editing of the merge result
  - add configuration file and settings dialog
    - kdiff3's settings: tab inserts spaces, tab size, auto indentation
- implement mmap for input file reading
- implement decoding filter for non-utf8 input files

The following features will follow when requested
- implement line preprocessing filter for input files
- (if it helps performance) implement a decoded/preprocessed line cache filter for input files
