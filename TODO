Already implemented:
- kdiff3's comparison algorithm (except for fineDiff)
- implement a sub-window that shows a file's content + scrolling up and down one line at a time (press i or j)

I plan to follow the following list from top to bottom for implementing new
functionality. 

- implement ncurses ui
  - horizontal scrolling within a sub-window
  - add line numbers to sub-window
  - diff view of three files. The only thing you can do is scroll up and down one line at a time.
  - add scrollbar (read-only, just to show where you are in the file)
  - also support just 2 files
  - implement resizing when the terminal is resized
- implement merging (without manual editing at first)
- implement manual editing of the merge result
  - add configuration file and settings dialog
    - kdiff3's settings: tab inserts spaces, tab size, auto indentation
- implement kdiff3's finediff
- implement mmap for input file reading
- implement decoding filter for non-utf8 input files

The following features will follow when requested
- implement line preprocessing filter for input files
- (if it helps performance) implement a decoded/preprocessed line cache filter for input files
