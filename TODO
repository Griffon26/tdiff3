An incomplete list of what is still to be done:

- add to documentation that xterm users should set: XTerm*metaSendsEscape: true, otherwise alt-1 a.o. won't work
- implement ncurses ui
    
  - also support just 2 files
  - add scrollbar (read-only, just to show where you are in the file)
  - create editable window (text only edited on screen, not backed by memory/file)

    movement keys:
    - pageup/down

    supported keys:
    - regular chars
    - delete, backspace
    - tab -> insert spaces upto tabstop
    - ctrl-c/ctrl-v -> copy/paste
    - ctrl-insert/shift-insert -> copy/paste

    selection keys
    - shift-arrows -> char/line selection
    - ctrl-shift-left/right -> word selection
    - shift-home/end -> select to beginning/end of line
    - ctrl-shift-home/end -> select to beginning/end of file
    - shift-page up/down -> select to prev/next page

    support for full-width characters:
    - move cursor 2 places with one keypress (this should make it impossible to
      start typing/deleting while in the middle of a full-width char)

  - implement memory/file storage for editable window
    - only store edits wrt the original content

  - graceful degradation of colors

  - add configuration file and settings dialog
    - kdiff3's settings: tab inserts spaces, tab size, auto indentation

- implement mmap for input file reading
- implement decoding filter for non-utf8 input files

The following features will follow when requested
- implement line preprocessing filter for input files
- (if it helps performance) implement a decoded/preprocessed line cache filter for input files
