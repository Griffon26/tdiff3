Already implemented:
- kdiff3's comparison algorithm (except for fineDiff)
- diff view of three files. The only thing you can do is scroll up and down one line at a time.

I plan to follow the following list from top to bottom for implementing new
functionality. 

- fix bug: d3ll should not have any completely empty entries at the end
- implement ncurses ui
  - fix horizontal scrolling to scroll all panes simultaneously
  - also support just 2 files
  - implement resizing when the terminal is resized
  - add line numbers to sub-window
  - add scrollbar (read-only, just to show where you are in the file)
  - create editable window

    supported keys:
    - arrows for navigation
    - regular chars
    - delete, backspace
    - home, end
    - pageup/down
    - ctrl-home/ctrl-end
    - ctrl-c/ctrl-v -> copy/paste
    - ctrl-insert/shift-insert -> copy/paste
    - tab -> insert spaces upto tabstop

    selection keys
    - shift-arrows -> char/line selection
    - ctrl-shift-left/right -> word selection
    - shift-home/end -> select to beginning/end of line
    - ctrl-shift-home/end -> select to beginning/end of file
    - shift-page up/down -> select to prev/next page

    diff specific keys
    - ctrl-up/down -> prev/next difference
    - ctrl-pageup/down -> prev/next conflict
    - ctrl-1/2/3 -> append/remove line from A/B/C at selected conflict position
- implement merging (without manual editing at first)
- implement manual editing of the merge result
  - add configuration file and settings dialog
    - kdiff3's settings: tab inserts spaces, tab size, auto indentation
- implement kdiff3's finediff
- implement mmap for input file reading
- implement decoding filter for non-utf8 input files

The following features will follow when requested
- implement line preprocessing filter for input files
- (if it helps performance) implement a decoded/preprocessed line cache filter for input files
